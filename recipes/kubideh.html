    <ul>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Lean ground beef</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> For the Basting Liquid</h2>
        <ul> <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Onion juice</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h4>Prepare the Meat</h4>
        <li>Gather the meat skewer ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place the onion in a food processor and process, scraping down the bowl occasionally, until completely pureed and juicy</li>
    
        <li>
            Remove from the food processor to a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, and press until almost all the juices have been removed. Reserve the onion juice.
            </li>
        <li>
            Place the onion puree in a medium bowl. Add the ground beef, salt, and pepper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Knead the mixture by hand for up to 10 minutes to create a smooth paste-like consistency. 
            This is a very important step to make sure the meat proteins have been properly bound and to ensure the meat paste will stay on the skewers.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover and refrigerate the mixture for 60 minutes for proper marination and resting.

            Prepare a medium-high (450Â°F) charcoal or gas grill fire. If using a gas grill, be sure to start the coals about 30 minutes before grilling the kababs. If using a gas grill, make sure to have the grill turned on for 15 minutes prior to grilling.
        </li>
        <h4>Make the Kabobs</h4>
        <li>Gather the basting ingredients and prepared meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Divide the prepared meat mixture into 4 equal round pieces.</li>
        <li>Using the reserved onion juice, dampen your hands as necessary and place one portion of meat mixture against the flat edge of one wide metal skewer.</li>


        <li>
            Stretch and squeeze the meat mixture carefully along both sides of the skewer until you have a 6- to 7-inch long kebab, about 1/4 inch thick on each side. 
            Make sure to thoroughly squeeze the meat mixture around the skewer to ensure you have a solid piece of kebab that is firmly attached to the skewer.
        </li>


        <li>
            Using your thumb and index finger gently press into the kebab to create uniform indentations that are about 1-inch apart. 
            This step creates a traditional design as well as further ensures the meat mixture is firmly pressed into the skewers. Repeat with the 3 remaining pieces of meat.
        </li>


        <li>Combine the butter, onion juice, lemon, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the butter has melted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Suspend the skewers over the charcoal and grill the kebabs until they are visibly darkened and seared while still remaining moist on the inside, flipping them every 30 seconds, 5 to 8 minutes total.

            This quick flipping ensures that both sides of the meat begin cooking immediately and evenly in order for the meat to stay on the skewer. Do not overcook the kebabs.</li>
        <li>Brush the kebabs with the basting liquid on both sides shortly before removing them from the grill. Place the skewers on a serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
       
        
    </ol>
